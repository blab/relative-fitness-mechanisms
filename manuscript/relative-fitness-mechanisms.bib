@article{Bekliz2024,
	abstract = {Since their emergence in late 2021, SARS-CoV-2 Omicron replaced earlier variants of concern and marked a new phase in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Until the end of 2023, Omicron lineages continue to circulate and continue to evolve, with new lineages causing infection waves throughout 2022 and 2023. In the population, this leads to a complex immunological exposure background, characterized by immunity derived through vaccination, in the 5th year of the pandemic in the majority of individuals followed by at least one or even multiple infections or only natural infection in individuals that did not receive a vaccine.In this study, we use eight authentic SARS-CoV-2 isolates (ancestral lineage B.1 and the seven Omicron lineages BA.1, BA.2, BA.5.1, BQ.1, XBB.1.5, EG.5.1 and JN.1.1) in a live virus neutralization assay to study immune escape in 97 human sera or plasma of different immunological backgrounds (vaccination, hybrid immunity due to one or two natural infections and natural infection without vaccination in children and adults).We showed a gradually increasing immune escape after vaccination and hybrid immunity in from B.1 to BA.1/BA.2 to BA.5.1 to BQ.1 to XBB.1.5 to EG.5.1, but remarkably, no more enhanced immune escape of JN.1.1 compared to EG.5.1, with the latter two showing almost identical neutralization titers in individuals with hybrid immunity due to one or more infections. In vaccinated but never infected individuals, neutralization was markedly reduced or completely lost for XBB.1.5., EG.5.1 and JN.1.1, while in those with hybrid immunity, titers were reduced but almost all sera still showed some degree of neutralization. After a single infection without vaccination, reduced or complete loss of neutralization occurred for BQ.1, XBB.1.5, EG.5.1 and JN.1.1 compared to BA.1/BA.2. Furthermore, we observed that, although absolute titers differed between groups, the pattern of immune escape between the variants remains comparable across groups, with strongest loss of neutralization for BQ.1, XBB.1.5, EG.5.1 and JN.1.1 was observed across the different immunological backgrounds. Our results show gradually increasing antibody escape of evolving Omicron lineages over the last two years of Omicron circulation until variant EG.5.1, but not anymore for the currently dominant lineages JN.1.1, suggesting other mechanisms than immune escape to be behind the rapid global emergence of JN.1.Competing Interest StatementIE has received research funding and speakers fees from Moderna for an unrelated research project (IIS).

@article{Eguia2021,
	abstract = {There is intense interest in antibody immunity to coronaviruses. However, it is unknown if coronaviruses evolve to escape such immunity, and if so, how rapidly. Here we address this question by characterizing the historical evolution of human coronavirus 229E. We identify human sera from the 1980s and 1990s that have neutralizing titers against contemporaneous 229E that are comparable to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We test these sera against 229E strains isolated after sera collection, and find that neutralizing titers are lower against these ``future'' viruses. In some cases, sera that neutralize contemporaneous 229E viral strains with titers >1:100 do not detectably neutralize strains isolated 8--17 years later. The decreased neutralization of ``future'' viruses is due to antigenic evolution of the viral spike, especially in the receptor-binding domain. If these results extrapolate to other coronaviruses, then it may be advisable to periodically update SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.},

@article{Gostic2020,
	abstract = {Estimation of the effective reproductive number Rt is important for detecting changes in disease transmission over time. During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, policy makers and public health officials are using Rt to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However, estimation of Rt from available data presents several challenges, with critical implications for the interpretation of the course of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic data, and, where possible, make recommendations. For near real-time estimation of Rt, we recommend the approach of Cori and colleagues, which uses data from before time t and empirical estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods that require data from after time t, such as Wallinga and Teunis, are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for retrospective analyses of how individuals infected at different time points contributed to the spread. We advise caution when using methods derived from the approach of Bettencourt and Ribeiro, as the resulting Rt estimates may be biased if the underlying structural assumptions are not met. Two key challenges common to all approaches are accurate specification of the generation interval and reconstruction of the time series of new infections from observations occurring long after the moment of transmission. Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other technical challenges and highlight open problems in Rt estimation.},

	abstract = {We develop stochastic variational inference, a scalable algorithm for approximating posterior distributions. We develop this technique for a large class of probabilistic models and we demonstrate it with two probabilistic topic models, latent Dirichlet allocation and the hierarchical Dirichlet process topic model. Using stochastic variational inference, we analyze several large collections of documents: 300K articles from Nature, 1.8M articles from The New York Times, and 3.8M articles from Wikipedia. Stochastic inference can easily handle data sets of this size and outperforms traditional variational inference, which can only handle a smaller subset. (We also show that the Bayesian nonparametric topic model outperforms its parametric counterpart.) Stochastic variational inference lets us apply complex Bayesian models to massive data sets.},

	abstract = {Seasonal coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1) are endemic to the human population, regularly infecting and reinfecting humans while typically causing asymptomatic to mild respiratory infections. It is not known to what extent reinfection by these viruses is due to waning immune memory or antigenic drift of the viruses. Here we address the influence of antigenic drift on immune evasion of seasonal coronaviruses. We provide evidence that at least two of these viruses, OC43 and 229E, are undergoing adaptive evolution in regions of the viral spike protein that are exposed to human humoral immunity. This suggests that reinfection may be due, in part, to positively selected genetic changes in these viruses that enable them to escape recognition by the immune system. It is possible that, as with seasonal influenza, these adaptive changes in antigenic regions of the virus would necessitate continual reformulation of a vaccine made against them.},

	abstract = {{New variants of SARS-CoV-2 show remarkable heterogeneity in their relative fitness over both time and space. In this paper we extend the tools available for estimating the selection strength for new SARS-CoV-2 variants to a hierarchical, mixed-effects, renewal equation model. This formulation allows us to estimate selection effects at the global level while incorporating both measured and unmeasured heterogeneity among countries. Applying this model to the spread of Omicron in forty countries, we find evidence for very strong but very heterogeneous selection effects. To test whether this heterogeneity is explained by differences in the immune landscape, we considered several measures of vaccination rates and recent population-level infection as covariates, finding moderately strong, statistically significant effects. We also found a significant positive correlation between the selection advantage of Delta and Omicron at the country level, suggesting that other region-specific explanatory variables of fitness differences do exist. Our method is implemented in the Stan programming language, can be run on standard consumer-grade computing resources, and will be straightforward to apply to future variants.}},
