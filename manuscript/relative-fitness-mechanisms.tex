%     Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 variants have repeated emerged, leading to large variant waves in populations of mixed immune backgrounds.
%     Classifying these variant viruses into genetically similar clades and lineages has allowed scientists to track the rise and fall of variants by modeling their frequencies over time.

%     In this paper, we derive existing frequency dynamic models from exponentially growing populations and extend them to show that relative fitness of variants can be derived from compartment models of infectious diseases.
%     We use these models to illustrate how transmission mechanisms such as increased intrinsic transmissibility and immune escape can affect frequency dynamics, including trade-off between preferred mechanisms and complications identifying mechanism.

%%% Introduction

%TODO: Flesh out, focusing on the emergence of looking at empirical variant advantage with frequency based model due to increased sequencing globally + tools like Nextclade.

The COVID-19 pandemic was marked by the successive emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses, driving repeated epidemics globally \cite{tegally2021detection, Volz2021}.
While these repeated large waves occurred with the emergence of novel variants, the mechanism driving these variants' success changed over time.
The spread of early variants such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta were largely driven by increases in intrinsic transmissibility \cite{carabelli2023sars}.
The Omicron variant showed substantial immune escape \cite{carabelli2023sars} and subsequent derived lineages within Omicron including XBB, EG.5.1 and JN.1 appear to be driven by immune escape as evidenced through molecular studies of neutralization using human sera \cite{Cao2021, Cao2022, Bekliz2024, Jian2023}.
Since 2022, there has been repeated replacement by subsequent Omicron-derived lineages.
This rapid viral population turnover is consistent with antigenic evolution and is observed in other viruses such as seasonal influenza \cite{bedford2014integrating}, although SARS-CoV-2 currently remains an outlier in terms of pace of its evolution \cite{kistler2023atlas}.
This transition from transmissibility-driven to immune escape-driven success is a consequence of the interplay between population immunity and variant fitness.

% Given the rapid emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants, it is important to assess the rate of turnover as this is an indicator of variant advantage and in addition to understanding how quickly a particular variant is spreading, it may signal the mechanism by which it spreads.

With the increased temporal and geographical scale of sequencing alongside a detailed genetic nomenclature \cite{rambaut2020dynamic} and bioinformatic tools for lineage assignment \cite{turakhia2021ultrafast, aksamentov2021nextclade}, we have gained more data for SARS-CoV-2 than for other circulating viruses giving a unique opportunity for insight into its evolution.
Several models of variant frequency have been developed to estimate the fitness of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants \cite{Annavajhala2021, Piantham2022, figgins2022sars, susswein2023leveraging, Lefrancq2023, abousamra2024fitness}.
These models estimate the relative fitness (or selective advantage) of circulating variant viruses from their frequency in sequencing data, typically represented by counts of variant sequences over time within a geographic region.
Relative fitness in these models is often assumed to be constant and intrinsic to the variant of interest, however this may be an oversimplification of the transmission process.
% Additionally, translating these relative fitness estimates to a population-level transmission advantage (in terms of variant infections per wildtype infection) typically requires assumptions on the generation time of the transmission though this can also be approached by jointly modeling the transmission process alongside frequencies \cite{Wallinga2006, figgins2022sars}.

It has been shown that these transmission advantages differ geographically and temporally, suggesting that variant transmission advantages are not necessarily fixed and may be informed by within-region population differences \cite{figgins2022sars, vanDorp2022}.
In fact, they may be well explained by regional differences in immune structure as Dadonaite et al.\ \cite{Dadonaite2023} show deep mutational scanning estimates of immune escape are well correlated with estimated variant growth advantages.
Existing models which allow variant transmission advantages to change in time generally do not have a mechanistic underpinning for why transmission advantages exist and vary geographically and temporally \cite{figgins2022sars, susswein2023leveraging}.
% These non-mechanistic transmission advantages are useful for real-time situation analysis though more work is required to develop theory for how various mechanisms determine viral fitness.
% In particular, distinguishing between mechanisms of immune escape and transmissibility may improve our ability to make informed short-term forecasts or include other forms of data to explain patterns of relative fitness.
This lack of mechanistic grounding limits our ability to accurately predict variant dynamics, especially in diverse geographic regions with varying levels of population immunity.

In response to this gap, we introduce a novel framework that links variant dynamics directly to transmission mechanisms using compartmental models of infectious diseases.
By modeling both intrinsic transmissibility and immune escape, we explain how shifts in population immunity shape the relative fitness of viral variants and select for immune escape over intrinsic transmissibility with increasing past exposure.
Furthermore, including these mechanisms suggests that relative fitness varies in time, reflecting the evolving landscape of population immunity and exposure regardless of the underlying mechanism.

Here, we present a novel non-parametric method for estimating time-varying fitness regardless of the underlying transmission mechanism.
Alongside this development we introduce a ``selective pressure'' metric that quantifies the impact of variant turnover on population-level epidemic growth rates, as well as a latent immunity model that we use to estimate the underlying proportion of pseudo-immune groups within multiple geographies and pseudo-immune escape rates for circulating variants.
Overall, our framework bridges the gap between genetic data and transmission dynamics, offering a new way to predict and manage viral outbreaks.

% TB: These two below paragraphs on predicting epidemic growth and latent immunity are too detailed for the normal `preview' of manuscript contents.
% Additionally, we introduce a ``selective pressure'' metric which quantifies the impact of variant turnover on population-level epidemic growth rates.
% Using this metric alongside historical case data, we develop a method for predicting  growth in incidence rates from sequence counts alone.
% This is especially useful when case numbers are under-reported or absent, as it can be used to give an early signal of variant-driven infection waves before widespread transmission occurs.
%
% Lastly, we develop a latent immunity model which we use to estimate the underlying proportion of pseudo-immune groups within multiple geographies and pseudo-immune escape rates for circulating variants.
% These pseudo-immune groups serve as a proxy for the immune heterogeneity between and within regions and the estimated pseudo-escape correlate with titer distances for circulating variants and human sera.
% This method enables a representation of variant similarity under escape-driven transmission similar to antigenic cartography using only genetic sequences.

% TB: If we keep this text it should be moved to the Discussion
% Overall, our framework bridges the gap between genetic data and transmission dynamics, offering a new way to predict and manage viral outbreaks.
% By linking viral evolution to immune escape and transmissibility, we offer a powerful tool for predicting variant-driven outbreaks and managing future waves of SARS-CoV-2.
% The selective pressure metric and latent immunity model provide critical insights into the epidemiological and immunological factors that drive variant success, improving real-time analysis using genetic sequence data alone and informing public health strategy.

\subsection*{Variant dynamics and relative fitness in multistrain models}

Multi-strain models of epidemics have been developed to understand the competition between different viral strains that exhibit different levels of cross-immunity \cite{Gog2002, bedford2012canalization}.
These models have typically been used to explain strain evolution in antigenically variable pathogens like seasonal influenza virus \cite{bedford2014integrating} and seasonal coronaviruses \cite{Kistler2021, Eguia2021}.

We begin by modeling a population of $V$ exponentially growing variant viruses each with prevalence $I_v(t)$ and time-varying growth rate $r_v(t)$.
By considering the difference in these growth rates, we can define the relative fitness as $\lambda_{v, u}(t) = r_v(t) - r_u(t)$.
This relative fitness determines the change in the frequencies of the variants in the population

\begin{equation}
    f_v(t) = \frac{f_v(0) \exp \left( \int_0^t \lambda_{v, \text{pivot}}(s)ds \right)}{ \sum_{u=1}^{V} f_u(0) \exp \left( \int_0^t \lambda_{u, \text{pivot}}(s)ds \right)},
\end{equation}

where $\text{pivot}$ is a chosen pivot variant which fitness is defined relative to.

In order to better understand frequency dynamics of pathogens with multiple co-circulating variants, we apply the above framework to compartmental models of epidemics, which can be written as time-varying exponential growth (detailed in Materials and Methods and Supplementary Text).
These models provide an intuition of how strain-level selection depends on the assumed transmission mechanism of the underlying epidemic model.
We summarize dynamics of a three-variant mechanistic transmission model in Fig.~\ref{fig:vis_mechanisms}.

% \subsection*{Estimating relative fitness using Gaussian Processes}

We develop a method for using Gaussian processes to model variant relative fitness.
Gaussian processes are probability distributions over functions, where the structure and smoothness of these functions are defined by a kernel that encodes correlations in time.
These models are flexible and allow us to encode smoothness constraints, periodicity, and other structures \cite{Gortler2019a}.
Gaussian processes allow us a non-parametric estimate of the relative fitness for variants through time (see Materials and Methods).
This model is used in Fig.~\ref{fig:gp_example} to estimate the relative fitnesses of different variants through time based on simulated variant sequence counts from frequencies shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:vis_mechanisms}.

\subsection*{Determining the transmisibility-escape tradeoff}

To understand the fitness trade-off between transmissibility and immune escape, we consider dynamics with one wildtype virus $\wt$ with $\varTransmission_\wt = 0$ and $\varEscape_\wt = 0$, an increased transmissibility variant $\varT$ with $\varTransmission_\varT > 0$ and $\varEscape_\varT = 0$ and an immune escape variant $\varE$ with $\varTransmission_\varE = 0$ and $\varEscape_\varE > 0$.

Following Equation \ref{eq:two_strain_relative_fitness}, we write relative fitnesses of the escape only variant or transmissibility increased variant as
\begin{align*}
    \lambda_{\varE, \wt} &= \varEscape \beta \phi_{\wt}(t)\\
    \lambda_{\varT, \wt} &= (\varTransmission - 1) \beta S(t).
\end{align*}

In the simplest case where individuals are either susceptible or have wildtype immunity ($S(t) + \phi_{\wt}(t) = 1$), we can compute the critical immune fraction $\phi^{*}$ at which $\lambda_{\varE, \wt}(\phi^{*}) = \lambda_{\varT, \wt}(\phi^{*})$ as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:critical_immunity}
    \phi^{*} = \frac{\varTransmission - 1}{\varEscape + \varTransmission - 1}.
\end{equation}

For past exposure level greater than $\phi^{*}$, escape variant have a higher relative fitness.
This trade off shows that increasing escape rate entails that a lower proportion of past exposure is needed for escape variants to be preferred (Fig.~\ref{fig:transmission_tradeoff}).
Additionally, this shows that when intrinsic transmissibility increases are limited escape is more likely to be a dominant mechanism for variant turnover.

We visualize this trade-off in Fig.~\ref{fig:transmission_tradeoff}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./figures/transmission_tradeoff.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Trade-off between immune escape and transmissibility increases.}
    A. Relative fitness for a transmissibility increasing variant and an immune escaping variant for $\varTransmission=0.3$, $\varEscape=1.2$, $\beta=0.875$.
    The intersection point shows the point after which the escape variant is has higher fitness.
    B. The critical exposure proportion is shown for various escape fraction and transmissibility increase. Above the critical exposure proportion, we expect dominance of escape variants.
    C. The minimum escape fraction needed for second waves to be comprised of escape variant assuming competition with transmissibility increase variants and first wave with a given $R_{0}$.}
    \label{fig:transmission_tradeoff}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Initial growth rates insufficient for predicting short-term frequency growth}

One question of interest is whether the mechanism meaningful informs our ability to forecast short-term frequency growth.
The first step to addressing this is to understand how the relative fitness may change in time to understand the predictability of relative fitness in the short-term.

We find that the mechanistic forms analyzed in this paper (see Supplementary text) can be represented as weighted combinations of $B$ time-varying functions $\upsilon_{b}(t)$ with weights $\beta_{b}$.
We can think of each of these functions $\Upsilon_b$ as an immune background and the coefficient $\beta_{b}$ as a transmission differential, so that

\begin{align*}
\lambda_{v,u}(t) = \sum_{1 \leq b \leq B} \beta_{b} \Upsilon_{b}(t).
\end{align*}

Even in the case of complete knowledge of the relative fitness and the underlying fitness contributions in the present and past, we have that change in the relative fitness is determined by

\begin{align*}
    \frac{d\lambda_{v,u}}{dt} = \sum_{1 \leq b \leq B} \beta_{b} \frac{d\Upsilon_{b}}{dt}(t).
\end{align*}

By considering a Taylor expansion of the relative fitness about the point of estimation $t_{0}$, we can approximate the relative fitness in the future as:

\begin{align*}
    \lambda_{v,u}(t) \approx \lambda_{v,u}(t_{0}) + \sum_{1\leq b \leq B} \beta_b \frac{d\Upsilon_b}{dt}(t_0).
\end{align*}

This suggests small differences in the form of $\lambda_{v,u}(t)$ can lead to meaningful differences in the future relative fitnesses through changes in the underlying immune backgrounds.

We investigate whether relative fitnesses vary predictably in the short-term regardless of mechanism, so that short-term forecasts are unaffected by mechanistic differences in the assumed transmission process.

To address this, we apply the two-variant model developed in previous sections for two different mechanisms (immune escape and increased transmissibility).
We fix the relative fitness of the novel variant at a prediction time $t_{0}$ using equation \ref{eq:critical_immunity} and assess the change in the relative fitness in the short-term.
We find that though relative fitness trajectories will share the same decreasing shape, they may decline at different rates depending on the mechanism (Fig.~\ref{fig:short_term_divergence}).
This can lead to large changes in the predicted incidence depending on the assumed mechanism and affects to overall rate of turnover.

\subsection*{Correlations insufficient for mechanism identification}

Variant growth advantages can be correlated with vaccination proportions even in the absence of immune escape.
Simulated multiple epidemics of a pure increased transmissibility variant at varying levels of initial vaccination and was able to see that estimated growth advantages, computed using a logit linear model, were correlated with initial vaccination fraction.

We find that you can estimate association of increased relative fitness due to vaccination in the absence of immune escape.
This appears to hold up until both variants' initial effective reproduction number is below 1 i.e. $V_{0} > 1 / R_{v}$.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./figures/correlation_not_mechanism.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Relative fitness is correlated with vaccination levels in the absence of immune escape.}

    }
\label{fig:mechanism_identification}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Quantifying selective pressure}

Though it is useful to quantify the individual relative fitnesses of individual variants, we are often interested in quantifying the overall effects of selection in the population.
This will occur not just on the level of frequencies and frequency growth, but additionally on the level of population-level growth rates.

Beginning again from our assumption of inhomogeneous exponential growth, we can write a differential equation for the total prevalence $I(t)= \sum_{v} I_{v}(t)$ as

\begin{align*}
    \frac{d I}{d t} &= \sum_{v} \frac{d I_{v}}{d t} =  \sum_{v} r_{v}(t) I_{v}(t)\\
                    &= \left( \sum_{v} r_{v}(t) f_{v}(t) \right) I(t),
\end{align*}

where we've used that $I_{v}(t) = f_{v}(t) I(t)$.
This allows us to see that $\overline{r}(t) = \sum_{v} r_{v}(t) f_{v}(t)$ is the average growth rate of the prevalence.
Re-writing the average in terms of some base exponential growth rate and the relative fitnesses so that $r_{v}(t) = \lambda_{v}(t) + r_0(t)$, we get that $\overline{r}(t) = \sum_{v} \lambda_{v}(t)f_{v}(t) + r_0(t)$.
We can now look at the rate of change in the average growth rate by taking its derivative.

\begin{align*}
    \frac{d \overline{r}}{d t} &= \frac{d r_{0}}{d t} + \sum_{v} \left[\frac{d \lambda_v}{d t} f_{v}(t) + \lambda_{v}(t) \frac{d f_{v}}{d t} \right]\\
                               &= \frac{d r_{0}}{d t} + \sum_{v} \left[\frac{d \lambda_v}{d t} f_{v} + \lambda_{v} f_{v} (\lambda_{v} - \overline{\lambda})  \right]\\
                               &= \frac{d r_{0}}{dt} + \sum_{v} \frac{d \lambda_v}{d t} f_{v}(t) + \sum_{v} \lambda_{v} (\lambda_{v} - \overline{\lambda}) f_{v}\\
                               &= \frac{d r_{0}}{dt} + \sum_{v} \frac{d \lambda_v}{d t} f_{v}(t) + \sum_{v} \lambda_{v}^{2} f_{v} - \overline{\lambda}\sum_{v} \lambda_{v} f_{v}\\
                               &= \frac{d r_{0}}{d t} + \Expect_{f(t)}\left[ \frac{d \lambda_v}{d t}\right] +  \Var_{f(t)}[\lambda_{v}].
\end{align*}

Here, we've written the last line in terms of expectations relative to sampling according to the frequency distribution.
This shows us that the change in the average growth rate of the epidemic can be written in terms of the growth rate of the pivot category, the mean rate of change in the relative fitness, and the variance of the relative fitnesses.
We will call terms which can be computed in terms of quantities derived from frequencies alone the selective pressure and denote it as

\begin{equation}
\psi(t) =  \Expect_{f(t)}\left[ \frac{d \lambda_v}{d t}\right] +  \Var_{f(t)}[\lambda_{v}].
\end{equation}

We can use this idea to directly write the prevalence in terms of the selective pressure and the base growth rate.
First, we define a cumulative selective pressure as
\begin{align*}
\Psi(t) = \int_{0}^{t} \psi(s) ds.
\end{align*}

We can then use this to reconstruct the relative incidence as:

\begin{align*}
    \frac{I(t)}{I(0)} &= \exp\left(\int_{0}^{t} \overline{r}(s) ds\right)\\
         &= \exp \left(\int_{0}^{t} [r_{0}(s) + \Psi(s)]ds \right).
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Predicting epidemic growth rates using selective pressure}%

Motivated by the relationship between the epidemic growth rate and the selective pressure demonstrated above, we developed a predictive model of the epidemic growth rate using estimates of selective pressure.
Using selective pressure computed using the approximate Gaussian process model, we predict the epidemic growth rate using the selective pressure for the previous 30 days.
We fit a gradient boosted regressor to data from 50 states in the United States between March 2021 and March 2022, reserving data between March 2022 and September 2022 for testing.
Our model is able to replicate patterns seen in estimates of the epidemic growth rates in England derived from ONS data between Jan 2022 and Sep 2022.

\subsection*{Latent factor models of relative fitness}

The representation of relative fitness using discrete immune backgrounds suggests that there may be low-dimensional structure to variant relative fitness.
To generate pseudo-estimates of this latent factors, we develop and implement our method for latent factors models of relative fitness.

We generate sequence counts for 14 countries and 41 variants in this period, estimating the relative fitness of each variant over time in each country, the pseudo-escape rates for each variant, and the pseudo-immunity for each country.
The results of these models are visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:latent_immune} for several selected variants and countries of interest.

We find that the distances in the pseudo-immunity embedding space are correlated with titer differences between variants ($R^2$ = 0.6).

%%% Discussion

\subsection*{Overview of methods}

% Mechanistic models
Our study demonstrates the utility of multi-strain mechanistic models in interpreting variant frequency dynamics.
This enables a more detailed picture of variant sucess in environments with heterogenous population immunity.

One key insight from this was the trade-off between intrinsic transmissibility increase and immune escape.
We showed that this trade-off is shifted by changes in population immunity, so that immune escape dominates as exposure increases.
Though there are limits to our ability to attribute dynamics to particular mechanisms from frequency data alone, the structure of these models suggests that we may improve forecasting by incorporating information about empirically supported mechanisms such as immune escape via antigenic evolution.

% Models we developed
Our work shows that even in the absence of data that can inform relative fitness, there is still hope.
We introduce a novel approach to estimate viral fitness over time using a scalable approximate Gaussian process model.
Traditional Gaussian process, while flexible, face challenges for large time-series and large data set.
Our approach overcomes this using a Hilbert Space Gaussian Process (HGSP) approximation, making the framework scalable for many variants and long time periods.
This enables real-time variant fitness estimation and can be applied to any frequency data regardless of the underlying mechanism.

% Selective pressure
In addition to estimating the relative fitness, metrics derived from these models can be informative of much more.
We present a ``selective pressure'' metric which allows us to model the contribution of evolution to changes in the epidemic growth rate of a population.
This metric acts as an early warning system for variant-driven outbreaks, especially in scenarios where case data are sparse or delayed.
By integrating fitness estimates and variant frequency dynamics, this metric can be used to predict epidemic growth rates, empowering public health agencies to anticipate and respond to new variant-driven outbreaks.
This metric has been validated using data from both the United States and the United Kingdom.
Furthermore, this approach is compatible with any method which estimates frequency and relative fitness, enabling broad applicability to many pathogens.

This provides a simple measure of epidemic growth in the absence of high quality case counts though it can be biased by non-evolutionary effects on the epidemic growth.
%Note: This should be the aim for next project, learning these non-genetic contributions using other data.

Additionally, we introduce a latent factor model which decomposes variant fitness into pseudo-escape rates and pseudo-immunity proportions.
This is offers a tool for a deeper understanding of immune dynamics and how they shape variant success.
The latent factor model, applied to SARS-CoV-2 data across several countries, successfully captures these immune escape dynamics and their impact on variant fitness.
 By using only genetic sequence data, we approximate the immunological distances between variants, providing insights similar to those gained from antigenic cartography but without the need for serological data.
 Further, we can estimate the proportion of these latent immune pools in the population and how they vary geographically and over time.
 This approach can be applied to other rapidly evolving pathogens, such as influenza, making it broadly applicable beyond SARS-CoV-2.

\subsection*{Conclusions, limitations, and future work}

Despite these advances, there are limitations to our approach.
Long-term forecasts remain difficult, particularly as new variants with unknown fitness profiles emerge.
This framework suggests that considering both the escape against individual immune backgrounds as well as the diversity in human immune escape is most useful for improving forecasts of relative fitness.
Additionally, our models, while powerful in estimating short-term variant dynamics, rely on assumptions about transmission mechanisms that may not always hold across different pathogens or contexts.
In fact, as we've shown, it's entirely possible for shifts in population immunity to change the dominant transmission mechanism.

Furthermore, the models considered here are deterministic in nature and do not explicitly model the emergence of variant viruses only the dynamics after their successful introduction.
In reality, there are biological constraints on the types of variants that are produced in nature and even if there is a "true" fitness boost, the chance for stochastic extinction of beneficial variants remains.
This presents trouble for long-term forecasting as it will require a model of emergence, tying the potential for a variant to emerge with its potential to transmit in the current environment.
Future work should focus on improving the integration of real-time genomic data with serological and epidemiological data, providing a more comprehensive understanding of variant dynamics over time.

% These ideas are already represented in existing literature through the form of long-term forecast models which incorporate phylogenetic and molecular data which is thought to be indicative of selection and immune escape. \cite{Huddleston2020, luksza2014predictive}

% Future work should seek to identify and integrative informative data sources for relative fitness estimation and forecasting for particular pathogens, providing a more comprehensive understanding of variant dynamics over time.

% Limitations of existing simple mechanism models
% The compartment models discussed here are described by simple mechanisms and more work is needed to adapt this framework to complicated epidemic models such as those with non-exponential generation times could be useful.
% That being said, models which account for the appearance of genetic variants through mutation exist, often assuming a latent antigenic space with which fitness is determined.
%
% However, it is important to note that these models may not be reliable for longer terms forecasts due to the emergence of new variants or improper specification of mechanism.

% Despite the limitations discussed above, the framework presented here illustrates the importance of transmission mechanism in the evolution of pathogens, highlighting the importance of both variant characteristics and population susceptibility in selection.
% We suggest that future models of pathogen transmission and evolution attempt to incorporate current knowledge of the transmission process into their forecasts.
% In particular, for viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 which undergo antigenic evolution, our work suggests that incorporating knowledge on both the diversity in human immune response and the escape potential of emerging variants could prove useful in improving long-term forecasts of the viral population.

In conclusion, our framework represents a significant advance in our understanding of viral evolution and transmission dynamics.
By linking variant fitness to specific transmission mechanisms, we provide a more nuanced and accurate prediction of how variants will spread and impact population-level epidemic growth.
The selective pressure metric and latent immunity model offer new tools for public health agencies to monitor viral evolution in real time, enabling proactive intervention and insight into the variant difference and wave potential.
While our work has been applied to SARS-CoV-2, the methods developed here are broadly applicable to other evolving pathogens, offering a versatile approach for improving epidemic forecasting, variant monitoring, and overall pandemic preparedness.

\section*{Materials and Methods}

\paragraph{Generating sequence counts}

We prepared sequence count data sets using the Nextstrain-curated SARS-CoV-2 sequence metadata \cite{Hadfield2018} which is created using the GISAID EpiCoV database \cite{khare2021gisaid}.
These sequences were tallied according to either their annotated Nextstrain clade or Pango lineage depending on the data set to produce sequence count for each variant, for each day over the period of interest, and in each location analysed \cite{aksamentov2021nextclade}.


\paragraph{Likelihood of sequence counts given frequencies}

The models discussed in this paper use counts of variant sequences to inform the underlying variant frequency in the population.
This is accomplished using a multinomial likelihood, so that given counts of sequences $C_{t,v}$ of variant $v$ at time $t$ and total sequences $N_{t}$ collected at time $t$, we have that

\begin{equation*}
    C_{t, \cdot} \sim \text{Multinomial}(N_{t}, f_{v}(t)),
\end{equation*}

where $f_{v}(t)$ is the frequency of variant $v$ at time $t$.
This is a simple model of sequence counts to frequencies and does not account for over-dispersion of sequence counts relative to a multinomial, however, all models can be extended to estimate and account for over-dispersion by replacing the above likelihood with a Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood.

\paragraph{Approximate Gaussian processes for relative fitness estimation}%

To generate smooth non-parametric estimates of variant growth rates, we develop a Gaussian process based model for relative fitnesses.
That is, we model the relative fitness for each variant $v$ over time as a multivariate normal distribution:

\begin{align*}
    \vec{\lambda}_{v} &\sim \text{Normal}(\vec{\mu}, \vec{\Sigma})\\
    \vec{\Sigma}_{s, t} &= K_{\theta}(s, t),
\end{align*}
where $K_{\theta}$ is a potentially parameterized kernel function.
This induces a structure on the covariance of the relative fitness values over time.


For computational efficiency, we implement a Hilbert Space Gaussian Process (HSGP) approximation instead of fitting $V$ independent Gaussian processes.
This approximation allow us to share basis functions between variants \cite{riutortmayol2022practical}.
Under this approximation, the relative fitnesses are computed as

\begin{equation}
    \lambda_{v}(t) \approx \sum_{j=1}^{m} S_{\theta}(\sqrt{\mu_{j}})^{1/2} \cdot \phi_{j}(t) \cdot \beta_{j},
\end{equation}
where $S_{\theta}$ is the spectral density of the kernel $K_\theta$, $\mu_{j}$ and $\phi_{j}$ are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, and $\beta_{j} \sim \text{Normal}(0,1)$ \cite{riutortmayol2022practical}.
Since the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are shared across variants, this allows us to re-use values across variants, simplifying the computation to a matrix multiplication as

\begin{equation*}
    \vec{\lambda}_{t} = \vec{\Phi}_{t} \sqrt{\vec{S}_{\theta}}\vec{\beta}.
\end{equation*}


For the analyses in this paper, we use this approximate Gaussian process with a Mat\'ern 5/2 kernel and shared hyperparameters across variants.
We use this model to estimate relative fitnesss for the simulated data in Fig.~\ref{fig:vis_mechanisms} which are visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:gp_example}.

\paragraph{Predicting epidemic growth rate from selective pressure}%

The derivation of the selective pressure metric shows that the selective pressure can be a useful tool in predicting the epidemic growth rate.
To develop a predictive model of epidemic growth rate using selective pressure, we begin by generating estimates of selective pressure and epidemic growth rate from a period with high sequencing and case surveillance.

We take sequence count and case count data from all states in the United States between March 2021 and March 2022.
Using the sequence counts, we compute selective pressure estimates from relative fitness and frequencies estimated with our approximate Gaussian process relative fitness model.

From the case data, we derive the empirical growth rate using a 14-day moving average on case counts $\hat{C}_{t}$ and computing the empirical growth rate as $\hat{r}_{t} = \log(\hat{C}_{t}) - \log(\hat{C}_{t})$.

We then use the past 28 days of selective pressure to predict the empirical growth rate.
We use a gradient boosting regressor model fit using a mean absolute error loss function.
% Our model uses a loss function which weights the mean absolute error and a smoothness loss on predicted trajectories.
% \begin{equation*}
%     \text{loss} = \text{MAE}(\hat{y}, y) + \alpha \text{Smoothness}(\hat{y}),
% \end{equation*}
% where $\alpha = 1\times 10^{-6}$ and $\text{Smoothness}(y) = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} (y_{t+1} - 2 y_{t} + y_{t+1})^{2}$.
% We fit this model using an AdamW optimizer with learning rate LEARNING RATE for NUM EPOCHS epochs.

We validate our model by comparing our predicted epidemic growth rates to estimates of the epidemic growth rates in England derived from ONS data between Jan 2022 and Sep 2022 as well as to held-out testing data for US states.
% As a baseline, we compare the results of this model to linear regression, lasso, ridge regression, and random forests.

% Mention model specification, cross-validation, and ...

\paragraph{Latent immune factor model}%

We show that relative fitness dynamics ought to be explained by low-dimensional immunity when transmission dynamics are described with compartment models.
This motivated a model to learn this low-dimensional structure that is inspired by latent-factor models.
We start by assuming that the relative fitness of variant $v$ at time $t$ and in geographic location $g$ can be described by $D$ latent factors so that

\begin{equation}
    \lambda_{v}^{g}(t) = \sum_{d=1}^{D} \varEscape_{v,d} \phi_{d}^{g}(t).
\end{equation}
As the structure here resembles Equation~\ref{eq:escape_relative_fitness}, we call the $\varEscape$ ``pseudo-escape'' and $\phi_{d}^{g}$ the ``pseudo-immunity''.
To make this more consistent with our intuition here, we model $\phi_{d}^{g}$ to be in $[0,1]$ and model it as smoothly varying in time.
In the results shown above, we model $\text{logit}(\phi_{d}^{g})$ using 4th order splines with 6 knots placed uniformly over the time period modeled.
Though we choose to model these latent factors with splines, other models would work here.
For example, one alternative would be the approximate Gaussian processes described above.
Additionally, in order to ensure identifiability of the parameter estimates, we fix some base variant $v^*$ which fitness is defined relative to, so that $\varEscape_{v^*, d} = 0$ for all $1\leq d\leq D$.
For the same reason, we order the components in the first geography.

We apply this model to SARS-CoV-2 sequence counts in the period between March 2023 to March 2024.

We compare the distances between variant pairs in our estimated pseudo-escape space to distances in log2 titer.

\subsection{Exponentially growing populations to frequency dynamics}%

We consider a viral population consisting of $V$ exponentially-growing variant viruses each with prevalence $I_{v}$.
Defining the time-varying growth rate for the prevalence of variant $v$ as $r_{v}(t)$, we can represent the prevalence using the following ordinary differential equation:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:inhomo_exp_growth}
    \frac{d I_{v}}{d t} = r_{v}(t) I_{v}(t), \quad v = 1,2, \ldots, V.
\end{equation}

The above differential equation has a known solution in terms of the integral of the time-varying growth rate and initial prevalence as follows:

\begin{align*}
I_{v}(t) = I_{v}(0) \exp\left( \int_{0}^{t} r_{v}(s) ds\right),
\end{align*}
where $I_{v}(0)$ is the initial prevalence of variant $v$.

Now turning to the frequency dynamics of the population, we write the frequency of variant $v$ in the population as  $f_{v}(t) = I_{v}(t) / \sum_{u=1}^{V} I_{u}(t)$.
This allows us to derive an ODE for variant frequency in terms of the variant growth rates using the quotient rule for differentiation:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{d f_{v}}{d t} &= f_{v} \left( \sum_{u=1}^{V} [r_{v}(t) - r_{u}(t)] f_{u} \right)\\
                        &= f_{v} \left( r_{v}(t) - \sum_{u=1}^{V} r_{u}(t) f_{u} \right).
\end{align*}

This system of differential equations resembles a logistic growth equation and can be shown to have the following solution in terms of the initial frequencies $f_{v}(0)$ and the variant growth rates:
\begin{align}
    f_{v}(t) &= \frac{ f_{v}(0) \exp( \int_{0}^{t} r_{v}(s) ds)}{\sum_{u=1}^{V}  f_{u}(0) \exp( \int_{0}^{t} r_{u}(s) ds)}.
\end{align}

The above representation of the variant frequency will serve as a centerpiece for many of the arguments to follow.
We see that by tracking the rate at which variant viruses are spreading, we can construct the corresponding frequency dynamics without knowing the absolute prevalence of any variant.

\paragraph{Relative frequency and relative fitness}%

Using the above equation for the variant frequencies, we can write the relative frequency of variant $v$ over $u$ as $x_{v,u}(t) = f_{v}(t) / f_{u}(t)$ to see:
\begin{align*}
    x_{v, u}(t) = \frac{f_{v}(t)}{f_{u}(t)} &= \frac{f_{v}(0)}{f_{u}(0)} \exp \left( \int_{0}^{t} [r_{v}(s) - r_{u}(s)] ds \right)\\
                                            &=x_{v,u}(0)\exp \left( \int_{0}^{t} \lambda_{v,u}(s) ds \right).
\end{align*}

Notice this relative frequency change depends on the initial relative frequencies and the \emph{relative fitness} $\lambda_{v,u}(t) = r_{v}(t) - r_{u}(t)$ of $v$ over $u$.
This relative fitness has the same units as the exponential growth rate (e.g. per day).
Using the definition of relative fitness, we can notice that
\begin{align}
\lambda_{v, u}(t) = r_{v}(t) - r_{u}(t) = \frac{d }{d t} \left[\log \left( x_{v,u}(t) \right) \right] = - \lambda_{u,v}(t)
\end{align}

We can see that there is a symmetry in the relative fitnesses and that the associated frequency dynamics depend on the differences between relative fitnesses.
This suggests that absolute fitness (in terms of the growth of infections) may not be inferable from frequencies alone.
This definition of relative fitness becomes essential in describing various existing modeling approaches for frequency dynamic data and motivates possible extensions since we can represent these models as having the form:
\begin{align}
    f_{v}(t) &= \frac{ f_{v}(0) \exp( \int_{0}^{t} \lambda_{v, \text{pivot}}(s) ds)}{\sum_{u=1}^{V}  f_{u}(0) \exp( \int_{0}^{t} \lambda_{u, \text{pivot}}(s) ds)},
\end{align}
where the growth rate of $v$ is expressed as relative to an arbitrary pivot variant.

\paragraph{Cumulative relative-fitness and frequency change}

Above we saw that within our framework frequency change over time intervals depends only on the cumulative relative fitness over time intervals $\Lambda_{v,u}(0, t) = \int_{0}^{t} \lambda_{v, u}(s)ds$.
We can then characterize approaches for modeling frequency change in terms of how they represent, estimate, and forecast these relative fitnesses.
This framework includes various existing methods for analyzing frequency data such as the seasonal influenza forecasting models of L{\"a}ssig and {\L}uksza \cite{luksza2014predictive} and Huddleston et al \cite{Huddleston2020}, multinomial logistic regression for frequency estimation \cite{Annavajhala2021} and the SARS-CoV-2 mutational fitness model of Obermeyer et al \cite{Obermeyer2022}.
%Question: How would I nest Piantham in this framework? Can I?

Though this framework can be used to describe existing statistical methods for frequency modeling, it is also applicable to traditional compartmental models of epidemics.
In fact, applying these ideas to compartmental models enables to see how mechanistic assumptions on the transmission process determine relative fitness of variant viruses.

\paragraph{Two-strain SIR}%

For simplicity, we will begin by analyzing a two-strain SIR model in which the a variant virus $v$ can differ from wildtype virus wt by increased intrinsic transmissibility (via $\varEscape_{T}$) and immune escape against wild-type immunity (via $\varEscape_{E}$).
This system of 5 ordinary differential equations follows

%TODO: Add 3.x
\begin{align*}
    \frac{d S}{d t} &= - \beta S I_{\wt} - \beta \varTransmission S I_{v}\\
    \frac{d I_{\wt}}{dt} &= \beta S I_{\wt} - \gamma I_{\wt}\\
    \frac{d I_{v}}{dt} &= \beta \varTransmission S I_{v} + \beta \varTransmission \varEscape \phi_{\wt} I_{v} - \gamma I_{v}\\
    \frac{d \phi_{\wt}}{dt} &= \gamma I_{\wt} - \beta \varTransmission \varEscape \phi_{\wt} I_{v}\\
    \frac{d \phi_{v}}{dt} &= \gamma I_{v}.
\end{align*}
where $I_{\wt}$ denotes wild-type prevalence, $I_{v}$ denotes variant prevalence and $\phi_{\wt}$ denotes immunity derived from wild-type infection.
In this model, the variant virus can infect both susceptible individuals $S$ and individuals with immunity to wild-type virus $\phi_{\wt}$.
Increased intrinsic transmissibility increases the baseline transmission rate from $\beta$ in wild-type to $\beta \varTransmission$ in the variant virus and immune escape increases the transmission rate against those with wildtype immunity, so that the at-risk population is $\varEscape \phi_{\wt}$.

Writing that $r_{\wt}(t) = \beta S - \gamma$ and $r_{v}(t) = \varTransmission \beta  S + \beta \varTransmission \varEscape \phi_{\wt} - \gamma$, we can then write the relative fitnesses as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:two_strain_relative_fitness}
\lambda_{v,\wt}(t) = (\varTransmission - 1)\beta S(t) + \varTransmission \varEscape \beta \phi_{\wt}(t).
\end{equation}

From this representation of relative fitness, we can see that given fixed increases to overall transmission ($\varTransmission > 1$) or immune escape ($\varEscape > 0$), the observed fitness boost at the level of variant relative fitness still depends on the proportion of the population at risk for infection.

\paragraph{$n$-strain SIR}%

This model can also be extended to an $n$-strain SIR model where each variant strain $v_i$ with $2\leq i \leq n$ is described by its own advantage parameters $\theta_{i} = (\varTransmission^{(i)}, \varEscape ^{(i)})$  relative to the wildtype ($\theta_{\text{wt}} = \theta_{1} = (0, 0)$).

\begin{align*}
    \frac{d S}{d t} &= - \beta S I_{\wt} - \beta \varTransmission S I_{v_{i}}\\
    \frac{d I_{\wt}}{dt} &= \beta S I_{\wt} - \gamma I_{\wt}\\
    \frac{d I_{v_{i}}}{dt} &= \beta \varTransmission_i S I_{v_{i}} + \beta \varTransmission_i \varEscape_i \phi_{\wt} I_{v_{i}} - \gamma I_{v_{i}}\\
    \frac{d \phi_{\wt}}{dt} &= \gamma I_{\wt} - \beta \varTransmission_i \varEscape_i \phi_{\wt} I_{v_{i}}\\
    \frac{d \phi_{v_{i}}}{dt} &= \gamma I_{v_{i}}, \quad i \in \{2, \ldots, n\}.
\end{align*}

In this formulation, the variant viruses compete only for susceptible population and those with previous wild-type infection.
This formulation can be generalized to allow for competition between all variants for any exposure history and will be discussed in the following sections.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:vis_mechanisms}, we implement and simulate a 3-strain model with wildtype as above, an escape variant E with $\theta_{2} = (0, \varEscape)$, and a transmissibility increase variant T with $\theta_{3} = (\varTransmission, 0)$.

\paragraph{Models of immune escape against heterogeneous backgrounds}%

We'll now consider a model where all hosts are assumed to fall into one of $B$ immune backgrounds $\phi_{b}$ for $b =1, \ldots, B$.
We assume that infection by each variant $v$ then leaves recovered hosts in the corresponding immune background of the most recent infection $b_{v}$.
Variant transmission then occurs via immune escape against a background leading to a matrix of escape rates $\vec{\varEscape} = \varEscape_{v,b}$ for variants $v$ and background $b$.

We can then write the system of ordinary differential equations as
\begin{align*}
    \frac{d I_{v}}{dt} &= \beta \sum_{1\leq b \leq B} \varEscape_{v, b} \phi_{b} I_{v} - \gamma I_{v}, \quad v = 1, \ldots, V\\
    \frac{d \phi_{b}}{dt} &= - \beta \sum_{1\leq v \leq V} \varEscape_{v,b}\phi_{b} I_{v} +  \sum_{v:\ b_{v} = b} \gamma I_{v}.
\end{align*}

With this model, susceptible and recovered compartments in the standard SIR model can be thought of as immune backgrounds.
This allows us to represent the standard SIR model as $S = \phi_{S}$, $I = I_{\wt}$, $R = \phi_{\wt}$ and $\varEscape_{\wt, S} = 1, \varEscape_{\wt, \wt} = 0$ and $b_{\wt} = \wt$.
We can also think of the two-strain SIR with $\varTransmission = 1$ as a special case of this model where we set $S = \phi_{S}, \varEscape_{\wt, S} = 1, \varEscape_{\wt, \wt} = 0, \varEscape_{v, S} = 1, \varEscape_{v, \wt} = \varEscape$ and keep all other parameters the same.

With this formulation of immune escape, we can then write the relative fitnesses in terms of the escape rates $\varEscape_{v,b}$ and the immune background proportions $\phi_{b}$ as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:escape_relative_fitness}
    \lambda_{v, u}(t) = \beta \sum_{1\leq b \leq B}(\varEscape_{v,b} - \varEscape_{u,b}) \phi_{b}(t).
\end{equation}

Under this model of immune escape, we can see relative fitness among variants can be decomposed into differences in immune escape among immune backgrounds within a population.
Due to the dependence here on the proportion of each immune background in determining fitness, this suggests that the overall distribution of susceptibility to strains is potentially an important consideration when translating individual-level measures of immune escape to population-level estimates of variant fitness.
Understanding the size and complexity of this immune space may therefore be useful for parameterization and forecasting of variant frequencies.
However, the extent to which modeling this complexity affects estimates of relative fitness also depends on how quickly the distribution of immune backgrounds change i.e. $\frac{d\phi_{b}}{dt}$.

Though the derivation above uses a simplified model of using most recent infection to sort individuals into an immune group, we show that a more complicated model that accounts for the entire exposure history of the host also gives a similar decomposition to relative fitness in Supplemental Appendix \ref{ssec:full_immune_history}.

\subsection{Revisiting existing models for frequency growth}

Using the theory developed for exponentially-growing variant populations, we now re-visit existing methods for modeling viral frequency dynamics.

\paragraph{Multinomial Logistic Regression}%

We begin with multinomial logistic regression (MLR) with fixed relative fitness.
This model can be written as

\begin{align*}
    f_{v}(t) = \frac{f_{v}(0) \exp(\lambda_{v} t)}{\sum_{u} f_{u}(0) \exp(\lambda_{u} t)},
\end{align*}

where $f_{v}(t)$ is the frequency of variant $v$ at time $t$ and $\lambda_{v}$ is the relative fitness of variant $v$.
This provides estimates of the relative fitness compared to some reference strain $u^{*}$ for which $\lambda_{u^*} = 0$.
In this model, initial frequencies $f_{v}(0)$ and relative fitness $\lambda_{v}$ are estimated from frequency dynamics.
Converting this estimate to an estimate of transmission advantage (relative effective reproduction number) requires assuming a delta distribution of the generation time \cite{Wallinga2006}.

Comparing this to equation \ref{eq:two_strain_relative_fitness}, we can see this model of fixed relative fitness results from assuming that the at-risk populations are constant over-time.
This assumption is useful since it requires no outside knowledge of the at-risk population and relative infection rates, though this may be less useful for longer forecasts or when there is large turnover in at-risk populations due to infection.

\paragraph{Fitness models of seasonal influenza}%

Motivated by the observed antigenic evolution of seasonal influenza, L{\"a}ssig and {\L}uksza \cite{luksza2014predictive} and Huddleston et al \cite{Huddleston2020} approximate the cumulative relative fitness between influenza seasons on the level of individual strains as

\begin{align*}
    \Lambda_{v,u}(t + \Delta t,t) = (\beta_{1} x_{v,1} + \cdots + \beta_{p} x_{v, p})\Delta t = (\vec{\beta} \cdot \vec{x}_{v}) \Delta t,
\end{align*}

where the relative fitness is determined by strain-specific predictors $\vec{x}_{v}$ and the regression parameter $\vec{\beta}_{v}$ are estimated.

This formulation fits neatly into the framework we've developed as the cumulative fitness here can be written as the integral of a relative fitness $\lambda_{v, u} =  \vec{\beta} \cdot \vec{x}_{v}$ over the time period of interest:

\begin{align*}
    \Lambda_{v,u}(t + \Delta t,t)  &= \int_{t}^{t+\Delta t} \lambda_{v,u}(s)ds\ = \int_{t}^{t + \Delta t} (\vec{\beta} \cdot \vec{x}_{v}) ds.
\end{align*}

Therefore, these models can be thought as regression-based predictors of relative fitness where frequency and external covariates contribute to estimated relative fitness.

\subsection{Relative fitness for full immune history models}\label{ssec:full_immune_history}

%TODO: Define powers sets + macro to simplify?
% $\mathcal{P}(M \setminus \{i\})$

We show that the simple background model is consistent with an expanded immune history model.
Beginning with the model from Lazebnik and Bunimovich-Mendrazitsky 2022 \cite{Lazebnik2022}, we consider the differential equation for the individuals with strain infection history $J$ and current infecting strain $i$ $R_{J}I_{i}$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dR_{J} I_{i}}{dt} = - \gamma_{J, i} R_{J} I_{i} + \beta_{J, i} R_{J} \sum_{K \in P(M), i\notin K} R_{K}I_{i}.
\end{align*}

Here, infection can occur from any individual infected with strain $i$ assuming their past immune history does not include $i$ and the infected are any recovered individual with immune history $J$  $R_{J}$.
To compute the strain growth rate, we can sum over all possible immune histories for individuals infected with strain $i$, so that
\begin{align*}
    \frac{d I_{i}}{d t} &= \sum_{J \in P(M), i \notin J} \frac{dR_{J} I_{i}}{dt} \\
                        &= - \gamma_{i} I_{i} + \sum_{J \in P(M), i \notin J} \beta_{i, J} R_{J} \sum_{K \in P(M), i\notin K} R_{K}I_{i}\\
                        &= - \gamma_{i} I_{i} + \sum_{J \in P(M), i \notin J} \beta_{i, J} R_{J} I_{i}\\
                        &= \left(-\gamma_{i} + \sum_{J \in P(M), i \notin J} \beta_{i,J} R_{J} \right) I_{i}\\
                        &= \left(-\gamma + \beta\sum_{J \in P(M), i \notin J} \varEscape_{i,J} R_{J} \right) I_{i}\\
\end{align*}

Assuming that the transmission rate can be decomposed as a base transmission rate $\beta$ and a strain $i$ and immune history $J$ specific escape rate $\varEscape_{i, J}$ and that the recovery rate is constant, we notice this is identical to our previous immune background model.
Therefore, our relative fitnesses can be written as

\begin{align*}
    \lambda_{i, j} = \beta \sum_{B \in P(M)} (\varEscape_{i, B} - \varEscape_{j, B}) R_{B},
\end{align*}
where for simplicity we define $\varEscape_{v, B} = 0$ if $v \in B$.
